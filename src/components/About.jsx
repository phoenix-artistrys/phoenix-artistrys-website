          Phoenix Artistrys was formed to help underground artists receive more
          acknowledgement for their work! We pride ourselves in our talented
          music and visual art team who bring this label together. Hope you
          enjoy what we have to offer!

          Since our label was established in 2020, we have put an emphasis on
          our compilation albums. Twice each year we gather all the featured
          songs from the past 6 months, and combine them into an assorted
          playlist. Every volume includes a mix, where all of the songs are
          combined into one continuous mix, creating a seamless listening
          experience.
